::: tip C Program

**C** (*pronounced like the letter c*) is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie), and remains very widely used and influential.  																					 			‘

**C Program Main standard**

**C99**

The C standard was further revised in the late 1990s, leading to the publication of ISO/IEC 9899:1999 in 1999, which is commonly referred to as "**C99**". It has since been amended three times by Technical Corrigenda.

**C11**

In 2007, work began on another revision of the C standard, informally called "**C1X**" until its official publication of ISO/IEC 9899:2011 on 2011-12-08. The C standards committee adopted guidelines to limit the adoption of new features that had not been tested by existing implementations.

**C17**

Published in June 2018 as ISO/IEC 9899:2018, C17 is the current standard for the C programming language. It introduces no new language features, only technical corrections, and clarifications to defects in C11.
