Threads and Locks</h1><p>While most of the discussion in the preceding chapters is concerned only with the behavior of code as executed a single statement or expression at a time, that is, by a single <em>thread</em>, the Java Virtual Machine can support many threads of execution at once. These threads independently execute code that operates on values and objects residing in a shared main memory. Threads may be supported by having many hardware processors, by time-slicing a single hardware processor, or by time-slicing many hardware processors.</p><p>Threads are represented by the <code>Thread</code> class. The only way for a user to create a thread is to create an object of this class; each thread is associated with such an object. A thread will start when the <code>start()</code> method is invoked on the corresponding <code>Thread</code> object.</p><p>The behavior of threads, particularly when not correctly synchronized, can be confusing and counterintuitive. This chapter describes the semantics of multithreaded programs; it includes rules for which values may be seen by a read of shared memory that is updated by multiple threads. As the specification is similar to the <em>memory models</em> for different hardware architectures, these semantics are known as the <em>Java programming language memory model</em>. When no confusion can arise, we will simply refer to these rules as &quot;the memory model&quot;.</p><p>These semantics do not prescribe how a multithreaded program should be executed. Rather, they describe the behaviors that multithreaded programs are allowed to exhibit. Any execution strategy that generates only allowed behaviors is an acceptable execution strategy.</p><h2 id="_17-1-synchronization" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_17-1-synchronization" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 17.1. Synchronization</h2><p>The Java programming language provides multiple mechanisms for communicating between threads. The most basic of these methods is <em>synchronization</em>, which is implemented using <em>monitors</em>. Each object in Java is associated with a monitor, which a thread can <em>lock</em> or <em>unlock</em>. Only one thread at a time may hold a lock on a monitor. Any other threads attempting to lock that monitor are blocked until they can obtain a lock on that monitor. A thread <em>t</em> may lock a particular monitor multiple times; each unlock reverses the effect of one lock operation.</p>',7),h=t("code",null,"synchronized",-1),m={href:"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.19",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},u=t("code",null,"synchronized",-1),p=t("code",null,"synchronized",-1),f={href:"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.3.6",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},b=t("code",null,"this",-1),v=t("code",null,"static",-1),y=t("code",null,"Class",-1),w=i('<p>The Java programming language neither prevents nor requires detection of deadlock conditions. Programs where threads hold (directly or indirectly) locks on multiple objects should use conventional techniques for deadlock avoidance, creating higher-level locking primitives that do not deadlock, if necessary.</p><p>Other mechanisms, such as reads and writes of <code>volatile</code> variables and the use of classes in the <code>java.util.concurrent</code> package, provide alternative ways of synchronization.</p><h2 id="_17-2-wait-sets-and-notification" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_17-2-wait-sets-and-notification" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 17.2. Wait Sets and Notification</h2><p>Every object, in addition to having an associated monitor, has an associated <em>wait set</em>. A wait set is a set of threads.</p><p>When an object is first created, its wait set is empty. Elementary actions that add threads to and remove threads from wait sets are atomic. Wait sets are manipulated solely through the methods <code>Object``.``wait</code>, <code>Object``.``notify</code>, and <code>Object``.``notifyAll</code>.</p><p>Wait set manipulations can also be affected by the interruption status of a thread, and by the <code>Thread</code> class&#39;s methods dealing with interruption. Additionally, the <code>Thread</code> class&#39;s methods for sleeping and joining other threads have properties derived from those of wait and notification actions.</p><h3 id="_17-2-1-wait" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_17-2-1-wait" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 17.2.1.

Implementations are permitted, although not encouraged, to perform &quot;spurious wake-ups&quot;, that is, to remove threads from wait sets and thus enable resumption without explicit instructions to do so.</p><p>Notice that this provision necessitates the Java coding practice of using <code>wait</code> only within loops that terminate only when some logical condition that the thread is waiting for holds.</p></li></ul><p>Each thread must determine an order over the events that could cause it to be removed from a wait set. That order does not have to be consistent with other orderings, but the thread must behave as though those events occurred in that order.</p><p>For example, if a thread <em>t</em> is in the wait set for <em>m</em>, and then both an interrupt of <em>t</em> and a notification of <em>m</em> occur, there must be an order over these events. If the interrupt is deemed to have occurred first, then <em>t</em> will eventually return from <code>wait</code> by throwing <code>InterruptedException</code>, and some other thread in the wait set for <em>m</em> (if any exist at the time of the notification) must receive the notification.

This removal from the wait set enables <em>u</em>&#39;s resumption in a wait action.

Interactions of Waits, Notification, and Interruption</h3><p>The above specifications allow us to determine several properties having to do with the interaction of waits, notification, and interruption.</p><p>If a thread is both notified and interrupted while waiting, it may either:</p><ul><li>return normally from <code>wait</code>, while still having a pending interrupt (in other words, a call to <code>Thread.interrupted</code> would return true)</li><li>return from <code>wait</code> by throwing an <code>InterruptedException</code></li></ul><p>The thread may not reset its interrupt status and return normally from the call to <code>wait</code>.</p><p>Similarly, notifications cannot be lost due to interrupts. Assume that a set <em>s</em> of threads is in the wait set of an object <em>m</em>, and another thread performs a <code>notify</code> on <em>m</em>. Then either:</p><ul><li>at least one thread in <em>s</em> must return normally from <code>wait</code>, or</li><li>all of the threads in <em>s</em> must exit <code>wait</code> by throwing <code>InterruptedException</code>.</li></ul><p>Note that if a thread is both interrupted and woken via <code>notify</code>, and that thread returns from <code>wait</code> by throwing an <code>InterruptedException</code>, then some other thread in the wait set must be notified.</p><h2 id="_17-3-sleep-and-yield" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_17-3-sleep-and-yield" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 17.3. Sleep and Yield</h2><p><code>Thread.sleep</code> causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease execution) for the specified duration, subject to the precision and accuracy of system timers and schedulers. The thread does not lose ownership of any monitors, and resumption of execution will depend on scheduling and the availability of processors on which to execute the thread.</p><p>It is important to note that neither <code>Thread.sleep</code> nor <code>Thread.yield</code> have any synchronization semantics. In particular, the compiler does not have to flush writes cached in registers out to shared memory before a call to <code>Thread.sleep</code> or <code>Thread.yield</code>, nor does the compiler have to reload values cached in registers after a call to <code>Thread.sleep</code> or <code>Thread.yield</code>.</p><p>For example, in the following (broken) code fragment, assume that <code>this.done</code> is a non-<code>volatile boolean</code> field:</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>while (!this.done)\n    Thread.sleep(1000);\n</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>The compiler is free to read the field <code>this.done</code> just once, and reuse the cached value in each execution of the loop. This would mean that the loop would never terminate, even if another thread changed the value of <code>this.done</code>.</p><h2 id="_17-4-memory-model" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_17-4-memory-model" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 17.4. Memory Model</h2><p>A <em>memory model</em> describes, given a program and an execution trace of that program, whether the execution trace is a legal execution of the program. The Java programming language memory model works by examining each read in an execution trace and checking that the write observed by that read is valid according to certain rules.</p><p>The memory model describes possible behaviors of a program. An implementation is free to produce any code it likes, as long as all resulting executions of a program produce a result that can be predicted by the memory model.</p><p>This provides a great deal of freedom for the implementor to perform a myriad of code transformations, including the reordering of actions and removal of unnecessary synchronization.</p><p><strong>Example 17.4-1. Incorrectly Synchronized Programs May Exhibit Surprising Behavior</strong></p><p>The semantics of the Java programming language allow compilers and microprocessors to perform optimizations that can interact with incorrectly synchronized code in ways that can produce behaviors that seem paradoxical.

Observable Behavior and Nonterminating Executions</h3><p>For programs that always terminate in some bounded finite period of time, their behavior can be understood (informally) simply in terms of their allowable executions. For programs that can fail to terminate in a bounded amount of time, more subtle issues arise.</p><p>The observable behavior of a program is defined by the finite sets of external actions that the program may perform. A program that, for example, simply prints &quot;Hello&quot; forever is described by a set of behaviors that for any non-negative integer <em>i</em>, includes the behavior of printing &quot;Hello&quot; <em>i</em> times.</p><p>Termination is not explicitly modeled as a behavior, but a program can easily be extended to generate an additional external action <em>executionTermination</em> that occurs when all threads have terminated.</p><p>We also define a special <em>hang</em> action. If behavior is described by a set of external actions including a <em>hang</em> action, it indicates a behavior where after the external actions are observed, the program can run for an unbounded amount of time without performing any additional external actions or terminating. Programs can hang if all threads are blocked or if the program can perform an unbounded number of actions without performing any external actions.</p><p>A thread can be blocked in a variety of circumstances, such as when it is attempting to acquire a lock or perform an external action (such as a read) that depends on external data.</p><p>An execution may result in a thread being blocked indefinitely and the execution&#39;s not terminating.

The detailed semantics of <code>final</code> fields are somewhat different from those of normal fields. In particular, compilers have a great deal of freedom to move reads of <code>final</code> fields across synchronization barriers and calls to arbitrary or unknown methods. Correspondingly, compilers are allowed to keep the value of a <code>final</code> field cached in a register and not reload it from memory in situations where a non-<code>final</code> field would have to be reloaded.</p><p><code>final</code> fields also allow programmers to implement thread-safe immutable objects without synchronization. A thread-safe immutable object is seen as immutable by all threads, even if a data race is used to pass references to the immutable object between threads. This can provide safety guarantees against misuse of an immutable class by incorrect or malicious code. <code>final</code> fields must be used correctly to provide a guarantee of immutability.</p><p>An object is considered to be <em>completely initialized</em> when its constructor finishes. A thread that can only see a reference to an object after that object has been completely initialized is guaranteed to see the correctly initialized values for that object&#39;s <code>final</code> fields.</p><p>The usage model for <code>final</code> fields is a simple one: Set the <code>final</code> fields for an object in that object&#39;s constructor; and do not write a reference to the object being constructed in a place where another thread can see it before the object&#39;s constructor is finished. If this is followed, then when the object is seen by another thread, that thread will always see the correctly constructed version of that object&#39;s <code>final</code> fields. It will also see versions of any object or array referenced by those <code>final</code> fields that are at least as up-to-date as the <code>final</code> fields are.</p><p><strong>Example 17.5-1. <code>final</code> Fields In The Java Memory Model</strong></p><p>The program below illustrates how <code>final</code> fields compare to normal fields.</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>class FinalFieldExample {

A later operation on the <code>String</code> object might see the correct offset of <code>4</code>, so that the <code>String</code> object is perceived as being &quot;<code>/usr</code>&quot;.
